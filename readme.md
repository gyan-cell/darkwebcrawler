# Dark Web Crawler with Flask & IBM Cloud

This is a simple dark web crawler built using Flask, IBM Cloud, and several Python libraries for scraping, processing, and analyzing data from dark web pages. The crawler extracts content and provides insights such as sentiment analysis and more.

## Overview

This project uses Flask as a web framework and leverages the following libraries for web scraping and analysis:

- **`ibm-db`**: For connecting to IBM Cloud databases.
- **`requests`**: For sending HTTP requests to access websites.
- **`bs4` (BeautifulSoup)**: For parsing and extracting data from HTML pages.
- **`textblob`**: For performing sentiment analysis on the extracted content.
- **`pysocks`**: To handle proxy connections for anonymity.
- **`json`**: For handling data exchange in JSON format.

The crawler fetches data from websites, performs sentiment analysis, and stores the results in an IBM Cloud database.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dark-web-crawler.git
    cd dark-web-crawler
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `ibm-db`
- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4` (bs4)
- `flask`
- `textblob`
- `pysocks`
- `json`

To install all the dependencies at once, you can use the `requirements.txt` file, which is included in the repository:

```txt
ibm-db
requests
beautifulsoup4
flask
textblob
pysocks

Setup Instructions

    IBM Cloud Setup:
        Create an IBM Cloud account if you don’t have one.
        Set up an IBM Cloud database and retrieve your connection credentials (such as username, password, and database name).

    Configure Database:
        In your Flask application, configure the IBM Cloud database connection by setting environment variables or directly in the code. You’ll need to reference these credentials in the appropriate sections.

    Proxy Configuration (optional):
    If you need to access dark web sites via a proxy, configure pysocks to route your requests securely and anonymously.

    Flask Application:
    Start the Flask application with the following command:

    flask run

    The application will be hosted locally, and you can interact with the crawler via the web interface.

Usage

Once the project is set up, the crawler will allow you to:

    Access web pages on the dark web using Flask endpoints.
    Extract and parse HTML content with BeautifulSoup (bs4).
    Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped content with TextBlob.
    Optionally, route requests through a proxy with pysocks.
    Store and retrieve data from an IBM Cloud database.

For example:

    Start the crawler: Open the web interface, input a URL, and begin crawling the page.
    Sentiment Analysis: After data extraction, the sentiment of the content is analyzed using TextBlob.
